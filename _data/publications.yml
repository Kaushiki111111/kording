  description: "In this paper, we simultaneously address the problem of semantic annotation of locations and location adoption dynamics of users. We propose our model HAP-SAP, a latent spatio-temporal multivariate Hawkes process, which considers latent semantic category influences, and temporal and spatial mobility patterns of users. The inferred semantic categories can supplement our model on predicting the next check-in events by users."

  description: "We propose a Multi-view Hypergraph Convolution Network (Multi-HGCN) where we learn POI representations by considering multiple hypergraphs across multiple views of the data. We build a comprehensive model to learn the POI representation capturing temporal, spatial and trajectory-based patterns among POIs by employing hypergraphs."

  abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of predicting the best answerer for a new question and thereby recommending the best expert for the same. Although there are work in the literature that aim to find possible answerers for questions posted in CQA, very few algorithms exist for finding the best answerer whose answer will satisfy the information need of the original Poster.
