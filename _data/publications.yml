  description: This paper addresses the challenging problem of predicting the best answerer for a new question and thereby recommending the best expert for the same. Although there are work in the literature that aim to find possible answerers for questions posted in CQA, very few algorithms exist for finding the best answerer whose answer will satisfy the information need of the original Poster.
