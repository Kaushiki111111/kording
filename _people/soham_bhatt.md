<!--## About Me
I'm a master's student in Data Science, doing my independent study and thesis with Dr. Kording. I also work full-time as a programmer for Dr. Michael Kahana and Penn's Computational Memory Lab. 

## My interests-->
M. Tech. in Smart Mobility, 2021-2023
<br>
Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering
## Research Interest:
My research focuses on Image captioning. I am working on developing a deep learning based model to generate descriptions of the images which are taken from drones.
<!--
Broadly interested in data, machine learning, and brains. I've done a lot of work with EEG and human memory in the past. Right now I'm excited about:
* Decoding brain activity using machine learning + applying to closed-loop algorithms
* Transfer learning / domain adaptation
* Open science initiatives, esp. tools for data standardization and sharing.
